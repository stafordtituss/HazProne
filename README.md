HazProne is a Cloud Pentesting Framework that emulates close to Real-World Scenarios by deploying Vulnerable-By-Demand aws resources enabling you to pentest Vulnerabilities within, and hence, gain a better understanding of what could go wrong and why!!

The framework helps gain practical, AWS Penetration testing knowledge/skills.
It consists of several vulnerable, close to real-world scenarios dubbed “Quests”. Each Quest would contain a flag that the user needs to find in-order to complete the quest.
Through this, a better insight into the different types of vulnerabilities and ways to exploit the AWS resources can be gained.

The framework contains four different quests as of today with the assurance that many more quests will be added in the near future.
